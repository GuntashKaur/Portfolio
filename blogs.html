            <p>
                Promise is method in advance Javascript. Before moving toward any heavy definition let's understand Promise with an example. Suppose a guy named xyz asked his friend to meet at a Resturant and his friend promised him that they will meet tomorrow. The Promise taken by the friend of xyz can be divided into three stages - <br> 1. Pending - Till the day arrive the Promise will remain Pending.
                <br> 2. Fulfiled - If xyz meet his friend tomorrow, the promise will get fulfiled.
                <br> 3. Rejected - If they can't meet, the promise will get rejected.
